## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites:
1. Ensure you have **Node.js** installed (v12.0 or higher).
2. Install **MongoDB** or use a cloud database (e.g., MongoDB Atlas).
3. If you haven't already, install **npm** (Node Package Manager).

### To get started:

#### Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/whereisit.git
cd whereisit
```

#### Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
